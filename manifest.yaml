# Host and Port to run proxy on.
port: 8080
address: 0.0.0.0

# Mapping of hosts to the proxy target.
mapping:
  - host: foo.localhost
    target: localhost:5000

  - host: bar.localhost
    target: localhost:3000

# In this mapping (for demonstration), your /etc/hosts file should contain:
# 127.0.0.1 foo.localhost
# 127.0.0.1 bar.localhost
#
# And webservers should be running locally on ports 3000 and 5000.
